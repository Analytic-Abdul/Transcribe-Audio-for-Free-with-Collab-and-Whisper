            "[12:07.180 --> 12:11.020]  So, yeah, with the Excel sheet, yeah, I will make up all these things.\n",

            "[12:39.500 --> 12:45.100]  how you are sharing OPEX, how you are sharing staff costs and how you are sharing cost of\n",
            "[12:45.100 --> 12:49.980]  sales. I can't even understand because we are getting consumables and it's defined. For sitting,\n",
            "[12:49.980 --> 12:55.100]  we already have consumables that we use for the current numbers that we've been seeing. I don't\n",
            "[12:55.100 --> 12:59.580]  think you've consulted us to see how much we've used because we keep our own cost of sales. You\n",

            "[14:04.940 --> 14:10.860]  done because in the first place, I don't know how you go to arrive at all your numbers.\n",
            "[14:11.100 --> 14:14.140]  Okay, so can I quickly just explain something?\n",
            "[14:14.140 --> 14:21.660]  So, yeah, this is not where to explain. Let's be clear to the owners. If I'm saying you should\n",
            "[14:21.660 --> 14:27.820]  be put an amount from another one stand, why are you explaining it here? Explain it at every level.\n",
            "[14:27.820 --> 14:34.220]  Okay, so if you take dialysis, take diagnosis, take clinical, let them understand what you have\n",
            "[14:35.180 --> 14:45.340]  put here. It's only just giving us one abstract thing. I mean, it's not clear. How do you\n",
            "[14:45.340 --> 14:52.700]  expect, how did you capture this? For instance, we've been discussing issues around pre-employment.\n",
            "[14:53.260 --> 14:54.540]  Where is it in all of this?\n",
            "[14:55.500 --> 15:01.500]  It's part of the, it would be, you know, it would be under the, those you write,\n",

            "[15:12.620 --> 15:18.860]  so I've already mentioned, we're moving an entire, maybe two departments moving there.\n",
            "[15:18.860 --> 15:22.300]  Some are still complicated, like Soji, we still have two theatres.\n",

            "[16:09.260 --> 16:14.220]  Well, if I have to ask you now, where did you put x-ray here? Is it number six or is it number eight?\n",
            "[16:15.500 --> 16:18.700]  Where did you put Nuswe here? Is it number six? Is it number eight?\n",

            "[16:26.540 --> 16:27.420]  Right. What else?\n",
            "[16:35.260 --> 16:41.980]  ICU is new, brand new. NICU is brand new. What else is brand new?\n",
            "[16:41.980 --> 16:45.900]  Here, it's not necessarily brand new, but it's just that we now have an effective\n",
            "[16:46.620 --> 16:52.140]  set up. You need to understand it like that to do something that will work.\n",
            "[16:57.180 --> 17:02.940]  Please take the feedback when they send it to you. You don't defend so that everybody understand how\n",
            "[17:02.940 --> 17:09.180]  we will work together. Yes, we are getting the budget at the top. We need to break it down.\n",
            "[17:10.060 --> 17:14.700]  Get your team. Daniel, I think he's the most experienced in supporting you and get something\n",
            "[17:14.700 --> 17:22.780]  that works. You start by sharing that Excel sheet with them and sit with them\n",
            "[17:22.780 --> 17:26.860]  to understand them, not fight or defend what you have done.\n",
            "[17:32.220 --> 17:34.300]  I will go around everyone and I will explain.\n",
            "[17:35.260 --> 17:39.980]  I will give you a feedback. Find a way to adjust it.\n",
            "[17:45.020 --> 17:47.820]  All right. Thank you, Mr. Olotunji. Thank you.\n",
            "[17:55.020 --> 17:56.300]  Moving on to the next, we have...\n",
            "[17:56.780 --> 18:05.100]  So, I know you have things that you know already that you want to\n",
            "[18:05.660 --> 18:10.780]  encourage us to speak to all of that in terms of the new business and the new things we are going\n",
            "[18:10.780 --> 18:17.500]  to do that will be extra on our... What was our guarantee at the time we closed?\n",
            "[18:26.300 --> 18:33.260]  We moved to 70 something. All that guarantee... We are about 270 million. That's about the last\n",
            "[18:33.260 --> 18:40.780]  time, 270. So, across contribution from one of us, we need an extra hundred, have we? Yes,\n",
            "[18:42.220 --> 18:43.500]  and then an extra hundred.\n",
            "[18:45.820 --> 18:49.820]  So, and it's based on the little you've done. You came up with your goals for 20\n",
            "[18:49.820 --> 18:55.260]  at the start of this session. You've had one or two people with you and I guess for\n",
            "[18:58.780 --> 19:03.820]  just speak to us and then I thought we'd marry Olotunji is there, you know, so what you see\n",
            "[19:03.820 --> 19:14.780]  is what you get from the people and then BG coming to support you. So, let's move on.\n",
            "[19:14.780 --> 19:18.220]  Let's hear from you guys. What's new? What are you doing?\n",
            "[19:19.500 --> 19:23.180]  Just speak to me. So, just, I don't know what the plan is for.\n",
            "[19:23.980 --> 19:29.420]  My issue with Ikeja is arbitrariness in my home. So, I need a plan for BG and BGC.\n",
            "[19:29.420 --> 19:32.300]  We're supposed to have our first meeting on Friday. This Friday.\n",
            "[19:32.300 --> 19:56.220]  I need to understand your plan for the other sense.\n",
            "[20:02.700 --> 20:04.220]  Our service. Okay.\n",
            "[20:05.260 --> 20:10.300]  I don't know. So, what's he got to speak with them on the board?\n",
            "[20:12.220 --> 20:18.540]  Yes, to find out what it takes to get an intern on his medical students.\n",
            "[20:19.180 --> 20:24.620]  Because he was saying he came up with a suggestion that his students supposed to work\n",
            "[20:24.620 --> 20:29.580]  supervised, but if they're going to do that sheets, then there's really nothing to check.\n",
            "[20:29.580 --> 20:58.220]  So, they can work with us during the day, supervise them and send them to night shifts.\n",
            "[21:00.220 --> 21:01.420]  This is just exchange.\n",
            "[21:07.100 --> 21:11.260]  It's training. They can do that as well. And they are not supposed to.\n",
            "[21:12.300 --> 21:15.660]  So, that's what I'm saying. If I'm going to do 24 hours, this is at night.\n",
            "[21:15.660 --> 21:19.900]  Nobody needs to be coming to check. I think it's something we can work with.\n",
            "[21:19.900 --> 21:25.980]  But he also mentioned that we need a presentation from their board for them to come on board.\n",
            "[21:26.780 --> 21:32.140]  This is for both internship and students.\n",
            "[21:34.780 --> 21:41.900]  Students in training, they don't finish to come and do internship.\n",
            "[21:42.940 --> 21:46.300]  Do you understand? So, you have students in training that want to do picking.\n",
            "[21:46.300 --> 21:50.780]  They are in school, but they can shoot all these things and just want to make money on the science.\n",
            "[21:51.740 --> 21:55.420]  And then you have interns that have done finished school,\n",
            "[21:55.420 --> 22:02.380]  but don't do internship before half job. So, those are the two options.\n",
            "[22:02.380 --> 22:08.300]  But he said that the board said we must have two senior regeographers employed.\n",
            "[22:08.300 --> 22:11.580]  Timothy is not a senior regeographer. The only person that can pass\n",
            "[22:11.580 --> 22:14.140]  for a senior regeographer is Ms. Duran, because she's a senior.\n",
            "[22:15.100 --> 22:25.580]  They didn't say senior. They just said what was written on that document shared with Ms.\n",
            "[22:25.580 --> 22:31.580]  Sue, a medical regeographer. So, we are at the point of making payments for the accreditation fee.\n",
            "[22:31.580 --> 22:37.660]  And so, yes, we are already free. Yes, we started with a finance act giving us the money.\n",
            "[22:37.820 --> 22:46.220]  So, we were filling the form, and we got to the point where they said we should submit certificates\n",
            "[22:46.220 --> 22:53.580]  of our medical regeographers. So, we reached out to Timothy, and Timothy said the certificate is\n",
            "[22:53.580 --> 22:59.340]  not ready now, but Ms. Sue has now said the certificate. So, we reached out to their board\n",
            "[22:59.340 --> 23:04.940]  again to say we have these two programs, but one is currently serving. Should we go ahead?\n",
            "[23:05.100 --> 23:09.820]  They said we shouldn't make payments until the certificate is ready. So, we are holding on to\n",
            "[23:09.820 --> 23:17.180]  the money now. So, we may have to wait until, you know, finishes, and then we can revisit\n",
            "[23:17.180 --> 23:23.740]  the accreditation things. So, we may not be able to start for 24 hours.\n",
            "[23:25.020 --> 23:31.980]  Except you want us to start and then use medical regeographers, which is based on our personal,\n",
            "[23:31.980 --> 23:36.940]  so as you are making the money, you are spending it on. I don't even think it's worth it because\n",
            "[23:36.940 --> 23:43.020]  it's night, and how many are we getting at night? Who made the money that we're using to pay the\n",
            "[23:43.020 --> 23:49.340]  regeographers to come and sit down? So, if it's not the internship or students we, I don't think it's\n",
            "[23:49.340 --> 23:56.460]  worth exploring, until Morgan can bring in more numbers. And in all honesty, the x-rays don't form\n",
            "[23:57.340 --> 23:59.340]  like that at night.\n",
            "[23:59.340 --> 24:04.540]  But what is it they said about people walk around, this film pain, are you excited?\n",
            "[24:04.540 --> 24:09.740]  Next one I'm coming to. So, for the film one, we've already finished three films, they couldn't\n",
            "[24:09.740 --> 24:18.540]  put it out. That's managed, yes, they reached out to tell us that they told them what to do.\n",
            "[24:19.260 --> 24:25.500]  So, by today, our IT is supposed to come up with the cables. The cables are available. Once they are\n",
            "[24:25.500 --> 24:30.300]  available, yes, to connect the trains. And so, hopefully, we should sort that out.\n",
            "[24:32.940 --> 24:49.100]  From the x-ray room, yes, they said they can do it with the guidance of Bauska Sailing.\n",
            "[24:56.220 --> 25:00.300]  For the architectural things, they know what they are passing.\n",
            "[25:00.300 --> 25:01.100]  What they are passing.\n",
            "[25:02.780 --> 25:09.580]  They have discussed that with Billy KD. So, that's what they're performing. I just found that,\n",
            "[25:09.580 --> 25:13.420]  what I was saying, that even by the machine, we can manage it in the x-ray room.\n",
            "[25:13.420 --> 25:15.820]  So, if anything, what that means cannot be explained.\n",
            "[25:18.700 --> 25:23.980]  It's not going to be, nobody will ever attribute it, I think. So, what is that coming that recently?\n",
            "[25:23.980 --> 25:30.460]  So, I came up with the option of partnering with Prisons. Prisons is just here.\n",
            "[25:30.460 --> 25:31.660]  Are they still there?\n",
            "[25:31.660 --> 25:33.100]  That's what Morgan said.\n",
            "[25:35.260 --> 25:36.380]  This is where I used it.\n",
            "[25:48.220 --> 25:52.540]  Don't need to speak with them. He said he has. I had a meeting with them yesterday. I was supposed\n",
            "[25:52.540 --> 25:58.140]  to be in that meeting. He didn't inform me. So, he said he was going to give feedback.\n",
            "[25:58.140 --> 25:59.420]  So, they have a mammogram.\n",
            "[25:59.420 --> 26:05.660]  They have a mammogram. So, I'm thinking if we have patients, we can, they will come here.\n",
            "[26:06.540 --> 26:14.700]  We can use things like whatever it is, take them to. Maybe I don't know what they want to use.\n",
            "[26:14.700 --> 26:21.500]  Take them there. They shoot it. Those ones give the images back to us. We will now package in our\n",
            "[26:22.460 --> 26:30.140]  and give out. And we can even use it to produce them for wellness. So, the only things I will not\n",
            "[26:30.140 --> 26:30.700]  add to that.\n",
            "[26:30.700 --> 26:32.460]  The pricing that you have to walk around with.\n",
            "[26:32.460 --> 26:33.660]  Yes, which shouldn't be a problem.\n",

            "[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  So, that's why we included Saturdays, so that we can maximize the potential.\n",

            "[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  Private is definitely private because you walk in, you pay us for the vaccines we give you.\n",

            "[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  We will not send them away.\n",
            "[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  No, we are not sending anybody away.\n",
            "[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  They leverage on it and they walk in.\n",

            "[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  So, in terms of revenue, I think a whole lot will come in because these are all HMO patients.\n",
            "[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  This is basically for private patients.\n",
            "[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  And because we are not saying register with Avon before you take your vaccination.\n",

            "[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  Go on.\n",

            "[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  So, we decided to run family planning on these Fridays.\n",
            "[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  So, that it can be available.\n",
            "[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  So, that we don't lose them.\n",
            "[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  Because what happens is we tell them to come.\n",
            "[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  And we have gone somewhere else before what we need.\n",
            "[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  Why would we not do it every day?\n",
            "[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  So, we were not doing it every day before.\n",
            "[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  Because we were considering quite a number of things.\n",
            "[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  First is mouth power.\n",
            "[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  Because it's not all nurses that give family planning.\n",
            "[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  So, family planning.\n",
            "[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  So, basically, it's just a few of the trained midwives.\n",
            "[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  They usually go for family planning training.\n",
            "[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  It's not even a phase.\n",
            "[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's not too current, it's imperfect.\n",
            "[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Is it still current, it's not perfect?\n",
            "[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  No.\n",

            "[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Every other thing is not new.\n",
            "[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  So, what are you all doing?\n",

            "[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  So, some of the things that we already planned to do last year that we could not maximize\n",
            "[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  is the...\n",
            "[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  So, for patients, because we know that number six is going to attract higher education,\n",
            "[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  so we are looking at it.\n",
            "[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  So, we are looking at it.\n",
            "[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  So, we are looking at it.\n",
            "[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  So, we are looking at it.\n",
            "[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  So, for patients, because we know that number six is going to attract higher education,\n",
            "[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  so we are looking at giving patients the option if you want the nurses to take care of your\n",
            "[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  baby afterwards throughout the period.\n",
            "[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  So, we allocate a nurse to a patient just to nurse your baby all the time, and then\n",
            "[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  you pay those for that.\n",
            "[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  But what we do is...\n",
            "[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  So...\n",
            "[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  Exactly.\n",
            "[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  Baby managers, that's the word.\n",
            "[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  That's the word.\n",
            "[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  So, like I said, it's very...\n",
            "[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  No, it's in the chat.\n",
            "[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  We'll put the same...\n",
            "[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  So, what we have put into consideration is how much we are going to generate.\n",
            "[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  So, what the plan is to employ somebody depending on the revenue we are able to generate.\n",
            "[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  Revenue we are able to generate from it.\n",
            "[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  Not even third-most party, maybe even nurse assistants, because basically what you are\n",
            "[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  doing is feeding baby, carrying baby, changing the diaper...\n",
            "[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  At home, I mean.\n",
            "[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  In the hospital, especially for mothers who have just had sedation, or two in gestation.\n",
            "[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  So, that's it.\n",
            "[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  That's wonderful.\n",
            "[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And then for patients who are also elderly patients, we have a couple of elderly patients\n",
            "[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  who their children didn't want them to come home, who were ready to discharge them, and\n",
            "[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  they kept stalling.\n",
            "[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  So, the plan is to attach a nurse to that person and deal with them for weeks.\n",
            "[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  These are ways we can generate revenue.\n",
            "[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  And another way I talked of is for instruments, autoclaving.\n",
            "[13:51.000 --> 14:00.000]  So, we noticed that when you are visiting for the life support of this plastic, they\n",
            "[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  have their own personal instruments, but they always look for ways to sterilize.\n",
            "[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  So, I recently have been telling the plastic surgeon that he can bring his instruments\n",
            "[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  to sterilize it for him, but we are billing depending on the size of the equipment or\n",
            "[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  the instruments.\n",
            "[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  So, for other people that have quite a number of instruments and they are big, we can bill\n",
            "[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  as much as 30,000 also to play once, and then you can't begin.\n",
            "[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  But we still have something like a tree, like this one, but they took this with us, and\n",
            "[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  this was 10,000 pounds to pay.\n",
            "[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  That's it.\n",
            "[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  That's it.\n",
            "[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  Every lab procedure.\n",
            "[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  It does sound like a hundred.\n",
            "[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  People have numbers.\n",
            "[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  How many people are you looking at here today?\n",
            "[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Should I expect them to come?\n",
            "[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  Everybody should do that.\n",
            "[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  It's not just sound interesting, but it must be achievable.\n",
            "[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  And they find a way to connect towards finance essentially.\n",
            "[15:10.000 --> 15:20.000]  I'm going to say the ideas are actually quite good.\n",
            "[15:20.000 --> 15:32.000]  In extension, for mothers in recovery, what if they request this baby minor's video?\n",
            "[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Is there permission?\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  Yes, but that will be that we don't have to start to accommodate that yet.\n",
            "[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  We employ the middleman.\n",
            "[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  We're employing for you.\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  We take our quotes and we feed the nurse attached to it.\n",
            "[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  So, it's going to be an external person?\n",
            "[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  So, we recruit the reprievement ourselves.\n",
            "[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  Because I was going to add the continuity of the person you're recruiting.\n",
            "[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  So, this is based on MCC.\n",
            "[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  So, the process is, once the person says I'm done with your nurse,\n",
            "[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  I don't need anyone to keep the person and tell the person that when we need you again,\n",
            "[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  we'll call you.\n",
            "[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  So, once we are done with you, you can bring it to us as long as possible.\n",
            "[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Just keep sending you to different zones.\n",
            "[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  Any other comments for taking your question?\n",
            "[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Okay.\n",

            "[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  So, I was telling her about the need to get a platform or something.\n",
            "[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  Instead, we need to get a certificate of operations.\n",
            "[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  We wanted to put...\n",
            "[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  So, we're setting up MCC on Monday.\n",
            "[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  So, we just want the place to be ready.\n",
            "[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  So, we started moving people from there.\n",
            "[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  So, I needed a few things.\n",
            "[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  So, I told...\n",
            "[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  Because we went there together.\n",
            "[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  I don't know if it's clear enough for those items.\n",
            "[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  We needed these tools.\n",
            "[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  And then, that's how it went out.\n",
            "[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  So, it really went out.\n",
            "[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  Out of bounds.\n",
            "[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  It noticed the door.\n",

            "[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Don't paint that thing.\n",
            "[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  If it's out of bounds, we need a proper out of bounds sign.\n",
            "[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  So, what I was trying to say is that we get it then.\n",

            "[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  So, if you wanted, we would request you to fill in the signature.\n",
            "[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  We know Sarah.\n",
            "[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  So, she now went to...\n",
            "[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  So, I told her to go to Sarah so that Sarah can get these things.\n",
            "[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  So, somebody can put them there.\n",
            "[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Because the rest of the room has no signage.\n",
            "[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  So, when she got to Sarah...\n",
            "[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  Because we're thinking by this week, everything will be...\n",
            "[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  If we don't move the oxygen...\n",
            "[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  Sarah now made the comments that we need to get...\n",
            "[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  That we can't start.\n",
            "[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  We can't start what?\n",
            "[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  We can't start.\n",
            "[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  We can't just move in there and start the operation.\n",
            "[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  And it was not easy.\n",
            "[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  So, I don't know.\n",
            "[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  I think we just talked to Sarah a little bit without carrying me along.\n",
            "[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  So, when Sarah said that you did do escalating...\n",
            "[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  So, Sarah...\n",
            "[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  One thing about Sarah is that Sarah will not escalate anything.\n",
            "[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  So, things stuck with Sarah.\n",
            "[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  And I told her, it's all the same logic.\n",
            "[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  But that's the way she knows how to work.\n",
            "[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  So, I can't really bend that.\n",
            "[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  But then, you that are requesting, you're asking her to report to someone.\n",
            "[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  The way she told you that you're escalating things.\n",
            "[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  So, it's that thing that I spoke to the DLs.\n",
            "[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  The same thing.\n",
            "[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  That we have submitted our papers.\n",
            "[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  But they are saying...\n",
            "[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  It's still in the process of...\n",
            "[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  To allow Sarah...\n",
            "[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  So, but that doesn't stop us from operating.\n",
            "[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  So, I don't know why she said that.\n",
            "[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  But I'll ask her.\n",
            "[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  Because it wasn't like that.\n",
            "[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  It was when I was putting her out of the operation.\n",
            "[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  That we want to start next week.\n",
            "[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  We have a return now.\n",
            "[20:03.000 --> 20:04.000]  We are going there.\n",
            "[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  But I'm not saying we shouldn't start.\n",
            "[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  You know what I'm saying?\n",
            "[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  If you can't do that, you need a separate operation.\n",
            "[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  You need to say we shouldn't start.\n",
            "[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  You know what we need to do?\n",
            "[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  We have to wait for you to come and see.\n",
            "[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  Because we started early.\n",
            "[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  We had...\n",
            "[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  In fact, I was the one pushing around last year.\n",
            "[20:21.000 --> 20:22.000]  So, it's not a solution.\n",
            "[20:22.000 --> 20:23.000]  It's for a new person.\n",
            "[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  For that facility.\n",
            "[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  For the building is there.\n",
            "[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Yes, they said we are...\n",
            "[20:28.000 --> 20:29.000]  Or...\n",
            "[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  Aftermath.\n",
            "[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Aftermath.\n",
            "[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  They said aftermath.\n",
            "[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  They said aftermath.\n",
            "[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  And we know it's...\n",
            "[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  The minister of health.\n",
            "[20:35.000 --> 20:41.000]  So, they told us that we need to register that facility.\n",
            "[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  No, we did not.\n",
            "[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  Because this was...\n",
            "[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  This was an illness of number 8.\n",
            "[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  This one is not an illness.\n",
            "[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  No, it's not an illness.\n",
            "[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  It's a problem.\n",
            "[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  Because there are other facilities in there.\n",
            "[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  That was all they told us.\n",
            "[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  They need to come and check.\n",
            "[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Because we have to register everything.\n",
            "[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  So, you don't allow things to stop with Sarah.\n",
            "[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  It's always right to me.\n",
            "[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  If you work with somebody and I just realized that this happens a lot.\n",
            "[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  Like, Sarah is a separate entity on the board.\n",
            "[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  And I would like to explain to you.\n",
            "[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  Maybe you have no reason to...\n",
            "[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  Well, if I have it...\n",
            "[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  Me, I just said I have it.\n",
            "[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  They pretend to be there.\n",
            "[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  I must make them pretend.\n",
            "[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  But really, I can't think about that thing.\n",
            "[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  Like, why...\n",
            "[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  I just said that we need to see how you're not creating...\n",
            "[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  Exactly.\n",
            "[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  So, you don't spell that.\n",
            "[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  You tell me you're not still there.\n",
            "[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  Nothing is stopping us.\n",
            "[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  I need to take you seriously.\n",
            "[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  But I just have to mention...\n",
            "[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  The person with the...\n",
            "[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  We've already had, like...\n",
            "[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  We've already had.\n",
            "[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  And they can't tell you not to...\n",
            "[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  So, don't stop anything.\n",
            "[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Just go ahead and be around.\n",
            "[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  Please.\n",
            "[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  We can start...\n",
            "[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Is there anything...\n",
            "[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  I can say, basically...\n",
            "[21:49.000 --> 21:50.000]  Thank you, Esumi.\n",
            "[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  So, basically, for clinicals, especially for the young people,\n",
            "[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  we have to have the data from the young people.\n",
            "[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  We have to have the data from the young people.\n",
            "[22:01.000 --> 22:12.680]  for clinical expansion, new services, three major new services, the ICU, the NICU and the theater,\n",
            "[22:12.680 --> 22:19.480]  because we're going to have to, most of us are calling to business development,\n",
            "[22:19.480 --> 22:23.160]  said that the people that should have come, they said this theater was small,\n",
            "[22:23.960 --> 22:31.720]  and then now we have a bigger space, so I don't think the numbers shouldn't come in at this rate.\n",
            "[22:47.320 --> 22:51.160]  And then I remember doing my presentation, Dr. Idris said I should give them numbers,\n",
            "[22:51.720 --> 22:55.720]  because I was thinking, honestly, they've concentrated more on\n",
            "[22:56.920 --> 23:05.400]  diagnosis, but now, so they're going to, I'm even going to route it through Charles,\n",
            "[23:05.400 --> 23:09.560]  these guys still work in silo, for example, separately, that's why I said this,\n",
            "[23:12.520 --> 23:17.400]  that's why I mentioned these two things, and I feel you should address them with him,\n",
            "[23:17.400 --> 23:23.480]  I mentioned two things that Morgan did, I told him, I had the expression when I said,\n",
            "[23:23.480 --> 23:27.800]  when these prisoners people come, let me know, let us sit down and have this discussion,\n",
            "[23:27.800 --> 23:32.600]  when we are done, we'll move to HR, and conclude on these things, Morgan still had that meeting\n",
            "[23:32.600 --> 23:37.080]  with them, in fact, when I was coming up to the office, I saw him downstairs, and they were going\n",
            "[23:37.080 --> 23:42.440]  to the theater, and these are the prisoners, I said are you really telling me that on the corridor,\n",
            "[23:42.440 --> 23:46.280]  and I walked out on me, that's when, the second one I told him we should\n",
            "[23:46.280 --> 23:50.840]  rise was this echo, since last year, I've been saying come and do this\n",
            "[23:50.840 --> 23:55.960]  literature, until tomorrow, we are not discussing anything with anybody, and then when we find him,\n",
            "[23:55.960 --> 23:59.480]  it will look as if I've, okay, I've discussed, he keeps telling me the same\n",
            "[24:00.360 --> 24:05.640]  thing he told me the last time, I've discussed with two different, I don't know what it is,\n",
            "[24:05.880 --> 24:10.440]  I'm telling them to come, I'm sending messages to Gloria to tell them to come in,\n",
            "[24:10.440 --> 24:14.360]  it's working in silence, I don't get it, call them, don't start,\n",
            "[24:14.360 --> 24:16.920]  okay, Gloria is on his lunch, he's calling them,\n",
            "[24:16.920 --> 24:21.960]  okay, but tell Gloria, call them, your mind on the phone, you don't concentrate,\n",
            "[24:22.840 --> 24:29.720]  if Gloria is doing that, Gloria, excuse me, Gloria, do this, you've been on that phone for too long,\n",

            "[24:40.920 --> 24:45.800]  she should hear and go and call them, she's not on seat, she went to sort out the lunch,\n",
            "[24:45.800 --> 24:50.680]  so she's not on seat now, she's coming back soon, she has already answered me on chance that she's\n",
            "[24:50.680 --> 24:59.480]  coming then. Yes Mr. Charles, please go to the boardroom. And Mogan. Yes both of you and Mogan.\n",

But I sent her a chat, she told me she was stepping out. So that was why I sent her a chat. So you did not blow her out? That was why I said she told me she was stepping out.\n",
            "[25:42.680 --> 25:57.680]  And when she stepped out, what was the plan? She believed in the state of the matter. That must be the sheer annuity of Sherwin. Why did she want to stop? There should be an action so that things go smoothly.\n",
            "[25:57.680 --> 26:18.680]  She stepped out, but you are zooming. Because now your phone is distracting you. There will be things they are talking about, you will be on the phone. If there is no step out, what does it take for Sherwin to just listen to you?\n",

            "[26:29.680 --> 26:45.680]  I said, why would you say that kind of thing? I don't think it's a big deal. Somebody hearing that has nothing, what they are doing is a big deal.\n",

            "[27:27.680 --> 27:36.680]  Okay, Mr. Charles, there was an issue with having a partnership with prisons.\n",
            "[27:36.680 --> 27:55.680]  It's not the issue. This is just not about prisons. We are discussing these parts. It's not about prisons, because it was on our case that we brought, we said we should come in. So tell us why they are here.\n",
            "[27:55.680 --> 28:00.680]  They are here earlier than you thought they should have been here.\n",
            "[28:00.680 --> 28:10.680]  Okay, for the new business, Dr. Sanoko mentioned the use of theatre. She says from your end, she has not received any...\n",

            "[28:25.680 --> 28:45.680]  Can you all give them a summary so that they know why they are here? And don't be specific to anything. Don't talk about any theatre already.\n",
            "[28:45.680 --> 28:54.680]  We started with the presentation for the budget distribution for 2025, which Mr. Tunji already did a presentation on that.\n",
            "[28:54.680 --> 29:16.680]  And he made it special for the different segments, including worksite clinics, Ekeja and Sue Larry in general. So for clinicals, he broke them down. Pharmacy as well. And that's the non-diagnostic aspects, clinicals, QA, then diagnostics.\n",
            "[29:16.680 --> 29:32.680]  So he did all that breakdown, which he said he would share. So after that, Dr. Ejero spoke about the new initiatives for diagnosis and dialysis, where she now brought up prisons and having a partnership with prisons.\n",
            "[29:32.680 --> 29:52.680]  So after that, we now moved on to Dr. Salako. That was actually now mentioned about the expansion of new services, the ICU, NICU and use of theatre, where she mentioned that up to date she has not seen any external consultants for use of theatre for number six.\n",
            "[29:52.680 --> 29:57.680]  So that was why you were now called in. So we'll now have discussion on that.\n",

            "[08:38.400 --> 08:40.040]  because HMO, the number will increase.\n",

            "[08:42.320 --> 08:44.160]  They will still route them through HMO.\n",
            "[08:44.160 --> 08:46.360]  So funding will not be made.\n",
            "[08:46.360 --> 08:47.880]  It's not the same fee, right?\n",
            "[08:48.880 --> 08:50.760]  Then on that,\n",
            "[08:52.760 --> 08:55.600]  we want to start, you know, with special needs.\n",
            "[08:56.880 --> 08:58.040]  So we go to the doctor.\n",
            "[08:59.680 --> 09:01.080]  Last year, we were meant to start,\n",
            "[09:01.080 --> 09:02.920]  but the two doctors that were supposed to come in\n",

            "[09:07.400 --> 09:09.360]  like pediatric neurodevelopment are,\n",
            "[09:09.360 --> 09:12.880]  so they relocated, but we are not very much interested.\n",
            "[09:13.120 --> 09:15.720]  So then for all that,\n",
            "[09:17.440 --> 09:18.960]  for revenue generation,\n",
            "[09:18.960 --> 09:22.000]  lucky you both, I'm happy you are here.\n",

            "[09:39.800 --> 09:40.880]  When I say use of theater,\n",
            "[09:40.880 --> 09:43.440]  you're looking for someone that needs space.\n",
            "[09:43.440 --> 09:45.160]  Use of consulting space.\n",
            "[09:46.080 --> 09:47.600]  That they are not, the rates you get here\n",
            "[09:47.600 --> 09:51.000]  is different from what you get in seven or eight or six.\n",
            "[09:51.000 --> 09:53.840]  There are different things listed there.\n",
            "[09:53.840 --> 09:56.000]  Those ones that came last year,\n",
            "[09:56.000 --> 09:58.360]  they came because rooms were on strike.\n",
            "[09:59.360 --> 10:01.080]  I mean, it should be a constant thing,\n",
            "[10:01.080 --> 10:05.040]  like somebody just having to sleep and wake up in the middle.\n",
            "[10:05.040 --> 10:07.880]  Then earlier, Walejo was talking about,\n",
            "[10:07.960 --> 10:11.240]  get just, are you done, Saga?\n",
            "[10:11.240 --> 10:12.080]  Yes, sir.\n",
            "[10:12.080 --> 10:15.240]  There are new folds, some are new folds.\n",

            "[10:17.320 --> 10:21.080]  We have to really, really be on top of this tariff.\n",
            "[10:21.080 --> 10:23.520]  And this is the last division.\n",
            "[10:23.520 --> 10:28.360]  Most of the calls out are asking for new price,\n",
            "[10:28.360 --> 10:31.320]  like increment, they are up.\n",
            "[10:31.320 --> 10:34.560]  And if that happens, if it is a general patient,\n",
            "[10:34.560 --> 10:37.080]  we might not be able to increase the tariff for them.\n",
            "[10:37.080 --> 10:40.960]  So it will affect our own revenue.\n",
            "[10:40.960 --> 10:43.080]  Some of our revenue, some of what we view them\n",
            "[10:43.080 --> 10:46.840]  as having to accommodate, but it's dropping at P50.\n",
            "[10:46.840 --> 10:48.160]  Do you understand what I mean?\n",
            "[10:48.160 --> 10:50.920]  Like for the EMC now, it can accommodate\n",
            "[10:50.920 --> 10:52.880]  because it's been good all along.\n",
            "[10:52.880 --> 10:57.880]  But it's going to drop, it's not going to take it from it.\n",
            "[10:57.920 --> 11:00.760]  Some, it will not even work, and if it's not going to work,\n",
            "[11:00.760 --> 11:03.080]  they will refer their patients to somewhere else.\n",
            "[11:03.080 --> 11:04.560]  So the numbers will drop.\n",
            "[11:04.560 --> 11:07.800]  So we need a lot of private patients,\n",
            "[11:07.800 --> 11:09.320]  a lot of private patients.\n",
            "[11:09.320 --> 11:11.440]  Lose their privates, they don't take,\n",
            "[11:11.440 --> 11:13.920]  they don't do HMO there.\n",
            "[11:13.920 --> 11:15.680]  And when they go there, they give them love.\n",
            "[11:15.680 --> 11:18.760]  They say they are good to me.\n",
            "[11:18.760 --> 11:20.200]  Like someone who was meant to have a surgery\n",

            "[11:25.200 --> 11:26.800]  And there's a way these guys work.\n",
            "[11:26.800 --> 11:28.520]  I've told you, the doctors,\n",

            "[20:11.640 --> 20:14.640]  It will attract potential clients\n",

            "[21:42.880 --> 21:45.280]  So this will enable in-house provision\n",

            "[21:48.040 --> 21:50.400]  Mind you enough, when we do surgery,\n",
            "[21:50.400 --> 21:52.240]  sometimes we find it difficult.\n",

            "[21:59.280 --> 22:01.240]  sending them to external lab,\n",
            "[22:01.240 --> 22:03.720]  or taking out their samples\n",
            "[22:03.720 --> 22:06.920]  to go and get this blood test done.\n",
            "[22:06.920 --> 22:08.400]  I don't think it's proper.\n",
            "[22:09.280 --> 22:11.560]  So this will also assist us,\n",
            "[22:11.560 --> 22:15.360]  especially in emergency surgical patient cases,\n",
            "[22:15.360 --> 22:18.520]  where the time is a factor.\n",
            "[22:18.520 --> 22:21.240]  So all the running around can be done in-house\n",
            "[22:21.240 --> 22:25.280]  rather than sorting it out to external care.\n",
            "[22:25.280 --> 22:28.960]  And it will save us cost of referring the staff\n",
            "[22:28.960 --> 22:30.360]  and our patients out\n",
            "[22:30.360 --> 22:33.000]  and also improve our revenue generation.\n",
            "[22:34.520 --> 22:37.640]  So moving on to radiological machines.\n",
            "[22:37.640 --> 22:39.440]  I think for AFRAN we can start\n",
            "[22:39.440 --> 22:43.560]  with just the basic ultrasound scan and X-ray.\n",
            "[22:43.560 --> 22:47.400]  The ultrasound scan, because we do antenatal care here,\n",
            "[22:47.400 --> 22:49.240]  those are our pregnant women.\n",

            "[22:55.840 --> 22:59.280]  If we have an in-house ultrasound scan machine,\n",
            "[22:59.280 --> 23:02.200]  we can be scanning these are our pregnant women.\n",
            "[23:02.200 --> 23:05.040]  It's a way to generate revenue.\n",
            "[23:05.040 --> 23:08.160]  And it will also make the antenatal services\n",
            "[23:08.160 --> 23:13.160]  more attractive to patients to use the facility.\n",
            "[23:13.160 --> 23:18.160]  Then the X-ray, I think is basic for a hospital\n",
            "[23:18.720 --> 23:21.360]  to also have an X-ray machine\n",
            "[23:21.360 --> 23:26.360]  so that we can do basic radiological investigations.\n",
            "[23:27.240 --> 23:30.160]  So the benefit of this,\n",
            "[23:30.160 --> 23:35.160]  it will enhance our antenatal and surgical patient's care.\n",
            "[23:35.160 --> 23:37.680]  It will also give us a competitive edge\n",
            "[23:37.680 --> 23:41.200]  because here in AFRAN, apart from this, our hospital,\n",
            "[23:41.200 --> 23:44.240]  I don't see any standard hospital around.\n",
            "[23:44.240 --> 23:47.800]  The two mushroom hospitals that opened last year,\n",
            "[23:47.800 --> 23:51.480]  they were shut down by the River State government.\n",
            "[23:51.480 --> 23:53.440]  So if we have all these facilities,\n",
            "[23:53.440 --> 23:57.480]  I think we'll be able to attract a lot of people\n",
            "[23:57.480 --> 24:00.480]  around these environments to use the facility.\n",
            "[24:09.440 --> 24:12.040]  The next step is automating the process,\n",
            "[24:13.120 --> 24:15.480]  automation of process and in priority.\n",
            "[24:17.400 --> 24:20.880]  Basically our equipments are still manual equipments.\n",
            "[24:20.920 --> 24:23.680]  I think we should upgrade to digital ones.\n",
            "[24:25.880 --> 24:30.880]  Use modern hospital beds and office area.\n",

            "[25:08.800 --> 25:11.680]  they can start benefiting on the phototherapy lights.\n",

            "[25:25.520 --> 25:27.840]  So this will help us overall\n",

            "[25:31.160 --> 25:33.760]  It will also improve our patient experience\n",

            "[25:36.000 --> 25:40.120]  It will reduce the technique doubts for poor results.\n",

            "[04:46.080 --> 04:49.160]  You can see how dirty the walls are.\n",
            "[04:49.160 --> 04:51.760]  It's still looking like the government facility\n",
            "[04:51.760 --> 04:52.600]  we inherited.\n",
            "[04:54.640 --> 04:57.200]  This is the theater toilets.\n",
            "[04:57.200 --> 05:02.200]  You can see termites as eating up through the roof\n",

            "[05:17.680 --> 05:19.480]  because of the termite infestation.\n",
            "[05:19.480 --> 05:21.280]  This is the scrub room area.\n",

            "[05:25.760 --> 05:29.600]  and it's looking as though it's almost falling down.\n",
            "[05:30.440 --> 05:32.640]  So it's something I think we need to work\n",
            "[05:32.640 --> 05:35.040]  as part of the civil work.\n",
            "[05:35.040 --> 05:36.600]  This is our recovery room.\n",

            "[05:41.880 --> 05:46.880]  So you can only imagine how much the termite has gone through\n",

            "[05:51.320 --> 05:54.880]  So why I did this here now,\n",

            "[06:15.800 --> 06:18.640]  I know it's not that expensive.\n",
            "[06:18.640 --> 06:23.040]  We can do it to attract our clients.\n",
            "[06:23.040 --> 06:27.040]  So this is one of the walls in Afan on my left.\n",
            "[06:27.040 --> 06:28.360]  You can see the beddings.\n",
            "[06:28.360 --> 06:30.160]  You can see the ties.\n",
            "[06:30.160 --> 06:35.160]  You can see even the overhead lockers and all that.\n",
            "[06:36.080 --> 06:38.320]  They are all old school.\n",
            "[06:38.320 --> 06:41.240]  I think we can actually improve.\n",

            "[06:59.600 --> 07:01.800]  one of the questions I wanted to ask is,\n",
            "[07:02.480 --> 07:06.120]  when, who bears the cost of the single market?\n",
            "[07:06.120 --> 07:07.880]  Because I know I read the SLA.\n",

            "[07:09.600 --> 07:11.280]  It's supposed to be there.\n",
            "[07:11.280 --> 07:13.000]  So I don't really need to do all this.\n",
            "[07:13.000 --> 07:14.840]  That's important.\n",
            "[07:14.840 --> 07:17.760]  That's why we're taking it a bit above.\n",
            "[07:17.760 --> 07:19.400]  So let me just briefly ask,\n",
            "[07:20.600 --> 07:22.880]  who gave you, were they in this situation\n",
            "[07:22.880 --> 07:24.400]  before they got building that stuff?\n",
            "[07:24.400 --> 07:27.040]  No, it wasn't that bad.\n",
            "[07:27.040 --> 07:29.280]  But that building, you gave this brand.\n",
            "[07:29.280 --> 07:32.000]  Yes, we took over the new building.\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:33.200]  So at the point of-\n",
            "[07:33.200 --> 07:34.360]  What I'm saying is about-\n",
            "[07:34.360 --> 07:35.200]  Yes, they were-\n",

            "[07:38.080 --> 07:42.120]  Old building that is now used as their library.\n",
            "[07:42.120 --> 07:47.120]  So when we went to take on the new building,\n",
            "[07:47.560 --> 07:48.920]  they were just telling us,\n",
            "[07:48.920 --> 07:51.160]  I mean, just as we made them there,\n",
            "[07:51.160 --> 07:52.960]  they were just telling us that that was where\n",
            "[07:52.960 --> 07:55.120]  they used to be, where they were.\n",
            "[07:55.120 --> 07:55.960]  Yeah.\n",
            "[07:55.960 --> 07:57.120]  So we took on that same,\n",
            "[07:57.120 --> 07:59.080]  we took over that new building\n",
            "[07:59.920 --> 08:01.120]  and we were never like this.\n",
            "[08:04.160 --> 08:09.160]  So the SLA says that they will be responsible\n",

            "[08:17.720 --> 08:18.800]  So I don't know.\n",

            "[08:44.320 --> 08:45.160]  because the-\n",

            "[09:11.200 --> 09:13.400]  And John is trying to tell his own false story.\n",
            "[09:13.400 --> 09:14.240]  Yes.\n",
            "[09:14.240 --> 09:15.080]  Everybody.\n",
            "[09:15.080 --> 09:16.920]  That is because we don't have enough money.\n",
            "[09:16.920 --> 09:18.440]  And they don't have gas in them.\n",
            "[09:18.440 --> 09:21.800]  But this can be obligated to what we are looking at.\n",
            "[09:21.800 --> 09:22.720]  It's their own.\n",
            "[09:23.560 --> 09:25.960]  We can't even afford this.\n",
            "[09:27.160 --> 09:28.480]  It's beyond us.\n",
            "[09:28.480 --> 09:30.000]  We can't afford this.\n",
            "[09:30.000 --> 09:33.400]  So really, then, let's work with us\n",
            "[09:33.400 --> 09:37.280]  and we can push this into a proper religion with them.\n",
            "[09:37.280 --> 09:38.880]  But it seems-\n",
            "[09:38.880 --> 09:40.960]  And we can't even go and change it to like Kenya.\n",
            "[09:40.960 --> 09:43.120]  What they're saying for-\n",
            "[09:43.120 --> 09:44.560]  To react on it.\n",
            "[09:44.560 --> 09:45.400]  Yes.\n",
            "[09:45.400 --> 09:48.120]  They give them co-brand until they say they want co-brand\n",
            "[09:48.120 --> 09:51.880]  because they are holding on tightly to that property.\n",
            "[09:51.880 --> 09:54.560]  So they don't want to release it to us.\n",
            "[09:54.560 --> 09:57.640]  We're at that point of wanting to change the color\n",

            "[10:06.280 --> 10:09.760]  But then, I wanted to ask\n",
            "[10:09.760 --> 10:11.600]  what I didn't want to interrupt you.\n",
            "[10:11.600 --> 10:14.120]  At the time, you said they brought,\n",
            "[10:14.120 --> 10:18.280]  the guys got an ultrasound scan\n",
            "[10:18.280 --> 10:23.280]  from the company, from transport.\n",
            "[10:25.520 --> 10:26.360]  What happened to that?\n",
            "[10:26.360 --> 10:28.480]  And that was when you were putting pressure on me\n",

            "[10:31.520 --> 10:33.480]  What happened to that scan?\n",
            "[10:33.480 --> 10:35.880]  Because I can see you are asking for another scan.\n",
            "[10:36.880 --> 10:40.360]  Okay, it's not like I'm asking for another scan.\n",
            "[10:40.360 --> 10:43.840]  It's, the scan they bought is the black and white model\n",
            "[10:43.840 --> 10:47.560]  of Mildred, the very first Mildred that came out.\n",
            "[10:48.200 --> 10:49.040]  And,\n",
            "[10:53.040 --> 10:56.880]  the old school Mildred that came,\n",
            "[10:56.880 --> 11:00.320]  the black and whites, the very first Mildred,\n",
            "[11:00.320 --> 11:02.760]  that was what they brought to us.\n",
            "[11:02.760 --> 11:06.600]  So that's Mildred for we that don't even have the skills.\n",
            "[11:06.600 --> 11:09.480]  You can only imagine how difficult it is to learn\n",
            "[11:09.480 --> 11:13.600]  with a black and white machine in current time.\n",
            "[11:13.600 --> 11:16.880]  So that is why that machine is packed there.\n",
            "[11:16.920 --> 11:19.760]  We are not using it at the moment.\n",
            "[11:19.760 --> 11:22.840]  And the other reason is that they don't want us\n",

            "[11:24.920 --> 11:27.760]  So that would be the reason that's happening.\n",
            "[11:27.760 --> 11:29.440]  But now, if you give them the skills,\n",
            "[11:29.440 --> 11:31.640]  they won't buy it from the other person.\n",
            "[11:31.640 --> 11:36.360]  So, claiming that our school is trying to make sense.\n",
            "[11:36.360 --> 11:37.200]  Exactly.\n",
            "[11:38.400 --> 11:39.240]  That's what they did.\n",
            "[11:39.240 --> 11:40.440]  I mean, that was what they said.\n",
            "[11:40.440 --> 11:41.760]  You know what I was thinking?\n",
            "[11:41.760 --> 11:43.840]  I don't have a question.\n",
            "[11:43.840 --> 11:45.040]  So I was also thinking as,\n",
            "[11:45.040 --> 11:47.000]  is this a clinic where young people are treated?\n",
            "[11:47.000 --> 11:48.920]  I'm not saying it's more than that.\n",
            "[11:48.920 --> 11:51.000]  They have admission, they have theater,\n",
            "[11:51.000 --> 11:52.800]  they have scientific research.\n",
            "[11:52.800 --> 11:54.520]  Yes, because I hear they're taking out surgery\n",
            "[11:54.520 --> 11:56.200]  and they're in a surgery clinic.\n",
            "[11:56.200 --> 11:57.440]  They admit some people.\n",
            "[11:57.440 --> 11:59.720]  They do, it's not a clinic, they say some.\n",
            "[11:59.720 --> 12:00.960]  They're not straight people.\n",

            "[12:07.760 --> 12:09.240]  No, transfer from Quotidians.\n",
            "[12:09.240 --> 12:10.080]  Yes.\n",
            "[12:10.080 --> 12:10.920]  They're not straight people.\n",

            "[12:19.840 --> 12:21.560]  They have, they have.\n",
            "[12:21.560 --> 12:24.400]  So this guy that was,\n",
            "[12:24.400 --> 12:28.080]  so the guy that was managing before we took over\n",
            "[12:28.080 --> 12:30.320]  is a very single person.\n",
            "[12:30.320 --> 12:31.720]  He retired.\n",
            "[12:31.720 --> 12:34.560]  He said we're not going to help him.\n",
            "[12:34.560 --> 12:36.680]  And then he has his own smaller thing.\n",
            "[12:36.680 --> 12:38.120]  So he's a GP.\n",
            "[12:38.120 --> 12:40.560]  We don't know, those are still the same thing.\n",
            "[12:40.560 --> 12:41.400]  Oh.\n",
            "[12:41.400 --> 12:43.200]  Where it comes on specifically.\n",
            "[12:43.960 --> 12:44.800]  Oh, to do the surgery.\n",
            "[12:44.800 --> 12:45.640]  Yes.\n",
            "[12:45.640 --> 12:46.480]  Oh, I see.\n",
            "[12:46.480 --> 12:49.400]  He's still in the office, in the university.\n",
            "[12:49.400 --> 12:51.440]  They still, they're doing all these things for,\n",
            "[12:51.440 --> 12:53.920]  but he has his own private practice.\n",
            "[12:53.920 --> 12:57.280]  So he was the guy that had been there all the while,\n",
            "[12:57.280 --> 13:00.680]  even when the place was a clinic\n",
            "[13:00.680 --> 13:02.960]  and they upgraded it to University, too.\n",
            "[13:02.960 --> 13:05.880]  So he told me almost the same thing.\n",
            "[13:08.480 --> 13:10.280]  Thank you, Dr. Sunde.\n",

            "[13:20.640 --> 13:21.880]  My first point is,\n",
            "[13:24.280 --> 13:28.640]  I think based on my conversations with the finance people\n",
            "[13:28.640 --> 13:29.800]  and sometimes with,\n",
            "[13:31.680 --> 13:33.400]  my name's Mr. Awoni.\n",
            "[13:33.400 --> 13:35.520]  This is John Awoni.\n",
            "[13:35.520 --> 13:37.600]  There are no, I don't think they'll be ready\n",
            "[13:37.600 --> 13:39.120]  to do any innovation.\n",
            "[13:39.120 --> 13:40.480]  What we should do,\n",
            "[13:40.480 --> 13:41.320]  I just want to suggest,\n",
            "[13:41.320 --> 13:42.920]  maybe we should just take this picture.\n",
            "[13:42.920 --> 13:45.440]  This picture Dr. Shogun has just shown.\n",
            "[13:45.440 --> 13:48.520]  We should just take it straight to Vincent.\n",
            "[13:48.520 --> 13:51.440]  If nothing changed, then we can now take it to Owe,\n",
            "[13:51.440 --> 13:52.280]  then to ENL.\n",
            "[13:53.760 --> 13:56.480]  Okay, I think that's the only way we can get there.\n",
            "[13:56.480 --> 13:59.920]  They kept talking about there is no gas, no money.\n",
            "[13:59.920 --> 14:01.320]  That has ruined their retreats.\n",
            "[14:01.320 --> 14:03.240]  No money, no money, no money.\n",
            "[14:03.240 --> 14:04.680]  And I think it's an eyesore.\n",
            "[14:04.680 --> 14:07.000]  I mean, this is something that has to change.\n",
            "[14:07.000 --> 14:08.960]  So we, as far as the,\n",
            "[14:08.960 --> 14:10.960]  maybe we should take it to the upper distinct,\n",
            "[14:10.960 --> 14:12.760]  ENL, Owe, at that point,\n",
            "[14:12.760 --> 14:14.720]  I'm sure something will be done.\n",
            "[14:14.720 --> 14:15.720]  Mr. Awoni.\n",
            "[14:15.720 --> 14:17.720]  That's what I said before.\n",
            "[14:26.600 --> 14:30.520]  Yeah, then my, from what Dr. Shogun's mentioned now,\n",
            "[14:30.520 --> 14:31.360]  I think-\n",
            "[14:31.360 --> 14:34.080]  Dr. Shogun, what do you think?\n",
            "[14:34.080 --> 14:36.520]  I think we should go through that without-\n",
            "[14:36.520 --> 14:38.960]  Very high on the ventures.\n",
            "[14:38.960 --> 14:42.160]  Because the natural thing that we can't go through,\n",
            "[14:42.160 --> 14:44.840]  people there, we don't have money.\n",
            "[14:47.240 --> 14:49.040]  Well, at least they are trying to do it in a way\n",
            "[14:49.040 --> 14:49.880]  that they can do it.\n",
            "[14:49.880 --> 14:51.960]  Because they are doing it in a way that they can do it.\n",
            "[14:51.960 --> 14:53.040]  That's what they are doing.\n",
            "[14:53.040 --> 14:55.400]  And they are doing it in a way that they can do it.\n",
            "[14:55.400 --> 14:57.320]  Shibato grid machines.\n",
            "[14:57.320 --> 14:58.320]  And Mr. Awoni.\n",
            "[15:00.000 --> 15:01.400]  And now we need to do it.\n",
            "[15:01.400 --> 15:03.680]  Obviously, it's not their hairline.\n",
            "[15:04.520 --> 15:05.360]  So what do you think?\n",
            "[15:05.360 --> 15:06.200]  So good.\n",
            "[15:06.200 --> 15:07.040]  What do we-\n",
            "[15:07.040 --> 15:11.000]  I think we should have that discussion with Vincent.\n",
            "[15:11.000 --> 15:12.440]  And maybe set it-\n",
            "[15:12.440 --> 15:14.600]  I will meet you with Vincent, happy?\n",
            "[15:14.600 --> 15:15.440]  Yes.\n",
            "[15:15.440 --> 15:18.920]  Then if he doesn't respond positively,\n",
            "[15:18.920 --> 15:20.640]  we can now escalate it.\n",
            "[15:25.480 --> 15:27.560]  Are you saying that none of these things are aware?\n",
            "[15:27.560 --> 15:28.400]  Is it aware?\n",
            "[15:29.400 --> 15:32.000]  I know he promised to paint the facility.\n",
            "[15:32.000 --> 15:32.840]  Is it aware of that?\n",
            "[15:33.040 --> 15:34.440]  Is it aware of the painting?\n",
            "[15:34.440 --> 15:37.600]  No, it's a different thing when someone sits high up\n",
            "[15:37.600 --> 15:39.920]  in his office there.\n",
            "[15:39.920 --> 15:41.840]  He has never entered that flat.\n",
            "[15:41.840 --> 15:43.760]  I came there, I walked into each of those,\n",

            "[15:45.800 --> 15:47.720]  Has Vincent done that?\n",

            "[16:47.560 --> 16:49.800]  So we were complaining bitterly about the generator,\n",

            "[16:52.720 --> 16:53.920]  And at the time,\n",

            "[17:02.880 --> 17:04.120]  those were comforts.\n",
            "[17:04.120 --> 17:06.200]  And he promised he was going to upgrade.\n",

            "[17:16.520 --> 17:17.360]  What did you do?\n",

            "[17:44.640 --> 17:47.280]  I said, they are not going to pay and all that.\n",

            "[17:55.880 --> 17:57.720]  They will come back and say, no,\n",

            "[18:15.320 --> 18:17.440]  because the data we gathered shows\n",

            "[18:20.640 --> 18:22.400]  and other things that we're doing there.\n",

            "[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  It says, cash in not special.\n",
            "[18:41.000 --> 18:43.400]  The internet will be our,\n",

            "[18:56.360 --> 18:58.160]  So don't stress, that's November.\n",
            "[18:59.040 --> 19:00.760]  November, last check.\n",
            "[19:00.760 --> 19:02.440]  Because she knew.\n",

            "[20:00.800 --> 20:05.080]  So I mean, we might just choose at least one entry first.\n",
            "[20:05.080 --> 20:08.760]  I'd see the pharmacy initially being easier.\n",
            "[20:08.760 --> 20:13.200]  But I mean, if at least it should just be,\n",
            "[20:13.200 --> 20:17.080]  somehow we can, we land on the island somehow.\n",
            "[20:17.080 --> 20:18.560]  That may just be, it's,\n",
            "[20:18.760 --> 20:19.920]  what we are 2G,\n",
            "[20:23.040 --> 20:28.040]  started from Joyce, Tobi, everybody comes here.\n",
            "[20:28.040 --> 20:31.040]  Daniel, Kufkev, stuff like that.\n",
            "[20:32.840 --> 20:34.800]  So all of that put together, we have that.\n",
            "[20:34.800 --> 20:37.880]  So it's the numbers we have, 10G for pharmacy.\n",
            "[20:39.200 --> 20:42.000]  For the hospital initiative,\n",
            "[20:42.000 --> 20:46.200]  what I'm looking at is if it's fascinating, we will learn.\n",
            "[20:46.240 --> 20:48.960]  And then the people we have in number eights\n",
            "[20:48.960 --> 20:53.960]  at the maximum, or in number eights without a theater,\n",
            "[20:56.800 --> 21:01.600]  without a TV room, without announcement.\n",
            "[21:01.600 --> 21:06.600]  So that just makes it a basic primary care focus center.\n",
            "[21:07.600 --> 21:09.800]  If you want to add all those three,\n",
            "[21:10.800 --> 21:12.240]  it's more expensive to go out to them.\n",
            "[21:12.240 --> 21:15.120]  But all of these numbers, I can't share that yet.\n",
            "[21:17.200 --> 21:22.200]  And then I see you, I think, Tobi has gotten\n",
            "[21:22.800 --> 21:26.600]  a comprehensive list from OEYD, is that, is it?\n",
            "[21:28.600 --> 21:30.240]  Yeah, that's why you're here.\n",
            "[21:30.240 --> 21:34.880]  So the only, okay, there are a few things on that list.\n",
            "[21:34.880 --> 21:39.640]  When I see the ventilator is the most expensive,\n",
            "[21:39.640 --> 21:44.200]  I think it's about, I think it's about the two.\n",
            "[21:47.040 --> 21:50.040]  The most, let me re-talk, 16G, not 13G.\n",
            "[21:52.000 --> 21:53.600]  We got to ask you machine,\n",
            "[21:53.600 --> 21:56.600]  so we're gonna move on to the dialysis machine\n",
            "[21:56.600 --> 21:58.680]  from the center to this place.\n",
            "[21:58.680 --> 21:59.840]  So let me find it in here.\n",
            "[21:59.840 --> 22:01.560]  I'm sorry, what would it cost?\n",
            "[22:01.560 --> 22:02.880]  Are you using the number?\n",
            "[22:02.880 --> 22:04.120]  It's in there for now.\n",

            "[22:06.120 --> 22:06.960]  Pass that in.\n",

            "[22:12.680 --> 22:15.440]  It's not in front, it's in the numbers to support it.\n",
            "[22:15.480 --> 22:17.680]  It's been 20 days, that was when they were showing it.\n",
            "[22:17.680 --> 22:18.840]  We got it, sir.\n",
            "[22:19.840 --> 22:21.560]  Is it in the numbers to them?\n",
            "[22:21.560 --> 22:23.240]  Are they occupied at the same time?\n",

            "[22:25.160 --> 22:26.000]  Learn from me.\n",

            "[22:31.520 --> 22:33.040]  So there's no machines at this place?\n",
            "[22:33.040 --> 22:36.080]  No, because they have two X, Y, Z.\n",
            "[22:36.080 --> 22:36.920]  They have...\n",
            "[22:36.920 --> 22:39.440]  There's negative and then the others are positive.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling.

            "[09:08.620 --> 09:09.820]  You didn't change anything?\n",

            "[09:18.540 --> 09:20.740]  I don't want to be something about you think,\n",
            "[09:20.740 --> 09:22.580]  since the moment.\n",
            "[09:22.580 --> 09:23.660]  Nothing was touched.\n",
            "[09:23.660 --> 09:25.300]  Morgan came back to me about,\n",
            "[09:25.300 --> 09:27.620]  I can't remember how much of a city it was.\n",
            "[09:27.620 --> 09:30.180]  That he said that it was too high.\n",
            "[09:30.180 --> 09:33.060]  That he feels it should be 70 key.\n",
            "[09:33.060 --> 09:35.700]  He now said, okay, if you feel that,\n",
            "[09:35.700 --> 09:37.340]  when I told him the same thing there,\n",
            "[09:37.340 --> 09:38.580]  I said that why don't you guys,\n",
            "[09:38.580 --> 09:40.260]  I don't know if he gave you that feedback.\n",
            "[09:40.260 --> 09:43.500]  I said, you guys, you come back and let us\n",
            "[09:43.500 --> 09:45.580]  have the final agreement on what\n",
            "[09:45.980 --> 09:46.820]  we are doing.\n",
            "[09:46.820 --> 09:48.820]  When he raised that point of 70 key,\n",
            "[09:48.820 --> 09:50.340]  he made sense to me.\n",
            "[09:50.340 --> 09:52.100]  But I told him that those rises that we got\n",
            "[09:52.100 --> 09:55.140]  that were higher were from foremost and broad places.\n",
            "[09:55.140 --> 09:56.900]  What is making our own difference?\n",
            "[09:56.900 --> 09:58.660]  I think he said something about contrast,\n",
            "[09:58.660 --> 10:00.260]  being separate or so.\n",
            "[10:00.260 --> 10:03.260]  So I now told him, I said, why don't we now sit down?\n",
            "[10:03.260 --> 10:05.460]  Because he said this one very badly.\n",
            "[10:05.460 --> 10:08.300]  What is on par via your mindset difference?\n",
            "[10:08.300 --> 10:12.020]  Let us sit down and say this is what we have agreed.\n",
            "[10:12.020 --> 10:13.940]  And these are the reasons why.\n",
            "[10:13.940 --> 10:16.300]  So tomorrow, zero feedback.\n",
            "[10:16.300 --> 10:19.500]  Okay, so let me speak to that, Dr. Ujumu.\n",
            "[10:19.500 --> 10:24.500]  And I'll try to speak to Morgan about a city scam.\n",
            "[10:25.540 --> 10:28.100]  You are giving your people, right?\n",
            "[10:28.100 --> 10:31.180]  You are bringing 20%.\n",
            "[10:31.180 --> 10:33.060]  You are giving them 20%.\n",
            "[10:33.060 --> 10:35.820]  So if you are giving them 20% from the private earnings\n",
            "[10:35.820 --> 10:37.340]  you are giving to you,\n",
            "[10:37.340 --> 10:41.660]  it means that you are far more below the private earnings.\n",
            "[10:41.660 --> 10:45.780]  So I now said, if you say it's very, very expensive,\n",
            "[10:45.780 --> 10:49.140]  then tell the doctor that is referring to you,\n",
            "[10:49.140 --> 10:50.820]  these are our price, right?\n",
            "[10:50.820 --> 10:52.780]  Put your own on top of this.\n",
            "[10:52.780 --> 10:54.820]  And I've seen one or two places like that,\n",
            "[10:54.820 --> 10:56.140]  they don't value.\n",
            "[10:56.140 --> 11:00.220]  Or if you are giving you, the private tariff is the same,\n",
            "[11:00.220 --> 11:02.580]  70,000, right?\n",
            "[11:02.580 --> 11:05.940]  And we are not giving 70,000 to you.\n",
            "[11:05.940 --> 11:10.420]  And they are taking 20% of from it.\n",
            "[11:10.420 --> 11:11.460]  It doesn't make sense.\n",
            "[11:11.460 --> 11:13.340]  Okay, so what I was explaining,\n",
            "[11:13.340 --> 11:15.420]  you are well aware of this case.\n",
            "[11:15.420 --> 11:18.260]  You're mixing what she said.\n",
            "[11:18.260 --> 11:19.660]  After we spoke about this,\n",
            "[11:19.660 --> 11:23.020]  this was regarding contrast being a standalone.\n",
            "[11:23.020 --> 11:27.780]  Normally, other places fuse contrast\n",
            "[11:27.780 --> 11:29.940]  and they are seated together and call it a,\n",
            "[11:29.940 --> 11:34.020]  like, for instance, in Formos, they call this 97,000.\n",
            "[11:34.020 --> 11:35.580]  Contrast is inclusive.\n",
            "[11:35.580 --> 11:37.020]  So ours, when we took it up,\n",
            "[11:37.020 --> 11:39.660]  it was like reading a very high number\n",
            "[11:39.700 --> 11:42.460]  and then we were still charging contrast separately.\n",
            "[11:42.460 --> 11:43.740]  Don't even understand.\n",
            "[11:43.740 --> 11:46.740]  Contrast is inside our pricing.\n",
            "[11:46.740 --> 11:48.740]  We never put it separately.\n",
            "[11:48.740 --> 11:50.460]  It's the only time that we see contrast,\n",
            "[11:50.460 --> 12:04.020]  it's like we already automatically to claim.\n",
            "[12:04.020 --> 12:05.300]  So in cases where we have-\n",
            "[12:05.300 --> 12:08.460]  Then if we now say there's a need for contrast,\n",

            "[22:12.180 --> 22:14.300]  So fertility usage as well.\n",

            "[22:26.900 --> 22:31.900]  We go to some of these SB companies\n",
            "[22:32.100 --> 22:34.380]  hospitals in the likes of Reddington.\n",

            "[22:47.660 --> 22:49.820]  compared to what you're doing to your team.\n",
            "[22:49.820 --> 22:53.460]  So it's another advantage for us to move around\n",
            "[22:53.460 --> 22:55.620]  to all those big hospitals.\n",
            "[22:55.620 --> 22:58.900]  You can sell a facility to them for the museum.\n",

            "[23:10.180 --> 23:12.780]  So for ambulance service also,\n",
            "[23:12.780 --> 23:15.740]  we have plan for ambulance service.\n",
            "[23:15.740 --> 23:18.980]  Nothing also, we also have plan for nothing.\n",
            "[23:18.980 --> 23:22.900]  But nothing in terms of mother and kid.\n",

            "[23:26.100 --> 23:28.660]  We are going to discuss that in the meeting.\n",
            "[23:29.620 --> 23:31.780]  We have been on this for long.\n",
            "[23:31.780 --> 23:33.460]  I can't take that.\n",
            "[23:33.460 --> 23:35.100]  For mother and kid.\n",
            "[23:35.100 --> 23:40.100]  So by now, if you expect like 100 people sitting down\n",
            "[23:40.100 --> 23:42.740]  for sentimental message,\n",
            "[23:42.740 --> 23:45.500]  we have sent the video in particular speaking.\n",
            "[23:45.500 --> 23:48.180]  There is a good deal on the sentimental deed.\n",
            "[23:48.180 --> 23:51.100]  You cannot see less than 100 people speaking.\n",
            "[23:52.100 --> 23:53.500]  So there are packages.\n",
            "[23:53.500 --> 23:55.980]  And those people, that company around,\n",
            "[23:56.020 --> 23:58.660]  we have one of the SCARPA, North Security.\n",
            "[23:58.660 --> 24:01.620]  It was part of them who turned the company around.\n",
            "[24:01.620 --> 24:05.740]  So we can leverage on our skills on that.\n",
            "[24:05.740 --> 24:10.460]  Because the one we are using in the national room\n",
            "[24:10.460 --> 24:12.020]  to do our genetic care,\n",
            "[24:12.020 --> 24:15.140]  I don't think that's going to let me want to go too much.\n",
            "[24:15.140 --> 24:17.060]  I have to see these notes,\n",
            "[24:17.060 --> 24:18.380]  take them to that hospital\n",
            "[24:18.380 --> 24:20.220]  to see how they are doing it.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling.
