            "[15:05.840 --> 15:25.840]  So if we are saying that people's performance is not matching their rating, then something is wrong with what we are measuring. So please, I'm begging you, we don't want to be measuring the wrong thing, because we are doing great service to the organization and to those who are really working very hard.\n",
            "[15:25.840 --> 15:46.840]  So if those that are not working hard are just getting promoted, just like that, I mean, something is wrong, and we don't want the things to be rewarding, maybe crazy. So I will beg you this time, we are almost there, I see that 2024 was better than 2023.\n",
            "[15:46.840 --> 16:03.840]  So 2025, I want to assume that, I mean, it will be better than 2022, but please let us put our best into these documents. It's like people's reporting card. So if what we are saying about the staff is not matching our performance, then there's a problem somewhere.\n",
            "[16:03.840 --> 16:27.840]  So, and we need to go back to that quarterly performance to say, some people will say, nobody told me that I'm not doing well, until this happens, that shouldn't be. Please, quarterly performance check then should be stopped, we should appeal to that, so that people will get their feedback in real time, and they can quickly adjust.\n",
            "[16:27.840 --> 16:42.840]  The part about labor and management is that, I want to speak to the fact that there were a lot of people who went on leave last year without, in fact, some staff even went without even requesting or calling.\n",
            "[16:42.840 --> 16:59.840]  It was at the point of them coming to me to say that they couldn't do their leave allowance. I asked them, when did you, have you gone on leave? And they said, I'm asking them, I did see your date request, and they are looking at me. So a whole lot of people went.\n",
            "[16:59.840 --> 17:19.840]  A whole lot, so I will split it into two. A few people went without even requesting at all, and they are very washed as line manager, because if you see that the staff is not present at all, you need to go and check your leave mood to see that.\n",
            "[17:19.840 --> 17:35.840]  If the staff has properly requested for leave, so I guess that was not the case last year. That was everyone was able to go and leave without requesting or calling. And the only platform for this, they said, were those PMYs that can use this module on this system.\n",
            "[17:35.840 --> 17:52.840]  I think they can use it. They actually don't take proper documentation in place. Then the second one is about people that will just assume that once their line one has approved, they can take off. This is wrong.\n",
            "[17:52.840 --> 18:05.840]  If you have two line managers, your two line managers must have approved, HR must have approved, that HR notification must get to you before you can go and leave. That's true.\n",
            "[18:05.840 --> 18:27.840]  That's true. Then I realized that a lot of people went on sick of last year. By the time I was listening to the sick of report of one day, there's nothing there. So we are just releasing people to say, I mean, some people can come, even the policy says that if you are ill from home, I mean, you can call the sick.\n",
            "[18:27.840 --> 18:44.840]  But by the time it is extended to the second day, it should be a sick of a proper sick of, and that thing should be on convey. There's a reason why there is a sick of, there is a provision for sick of on convey.\n",
            "[18:44.840 --> 19:02.840]  So if we just went on sick of, not on convey, we are line managers, we are not monitoring it there. Please, it is not good enough. That means we are not properly accounting for our staff. Please let us see through all of this this year.\n",
            "[19:02.840 --> 19:23.840]  It's very, very important. And there's also influence to all of us. All leave are properly planned for, not clashing, and nothing was not properly done last year. And that is why we see that happiness is on 2024, leaving 2025.\n",
            "[19:23.840 --> 19:50.840]  And a whole lot of them, like five of them, she came to me and was asking for exceptional approval for them. So I feel that it can be better done than the way it was done last year, because they have the numbers and we said that by the time three or four people start doing their leave from January, it would have gone down by December.\n",
            "[19:50.840 --> 20:14.840]  And if we come to show, and they need probably like one person to replace that number, we can give them. But to now say in December, we have like five people that are not going on 2024. I mean, it's just that it's just seems like we are saying this is the policy. I'm like pointing people to violations. Thank you.\n",
            "[20:14.840 --> 20:19.840]  Thank you.\n",
            "[20:19.840 --> 20:23.840]  Well said.\n",
            "[20:23.840 --> 20:31.840]  We make our KPI is very, very strict.\n",
            "[20:31.840 --> 20:35.840]  I think so many very specific points.\n",
            "[20:35.840 --> 20:39.840]  Smart and clear.\n",
            "[20:39.840 --> 20:41.840]  Nothing more than that.\n",
            "[20:41.840 --> 20:48.840]  We just use those nine things on the KPI.\n",
            "[20:48.840 --> 20:54.840]  We have nine parameters.\n",
            "[20:54.840 --> 20:58.840]  Don't break it too much.\n",
            "[20:58.840 --> 21:02.840]  So it's easy to.\n",
            "[21:03.840 --> 21:05.840]  It gives too many.\n",
            "[21:05.840 --> 21:11.840]  So we should speak to maybe one key thing that would answer all.\n",
            "[21:11.840 --> 21:17.840]  Like if you have people in growth and business, you should be one thing that will speak to it.\n",
            "[21:17.840 --> 21:27.840]  I think it's too broad to measure.\n",
            "[21:27.840 --> 21:34.840]  Not too many lines.\n",

            "[21:46.840 --> 21:54.840]  Just to add, you know, we did a good session last and it's not, there's nothing like a fantastic session.\n",
            "[21:54.840 --> 21:56.840]  And then we throw everything into it.\n",
            "[21:56.840 --> 21:57.840]  Right.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling.

            "[06:01.060 --> 06:02.780]  Can everyone see my screen?\n",
            "[06:02.780 --> 06:04.860]  Yes, we can.\n",
            "[06:04.860 --> 06:10.020]  Okay, so this slide talks about the budget for every location and this is actually picked\n",
            "[06:10.020 --> 06:13.300]  from the revenue input, the exact sheet that we used to.\n",
            "[06:13.300 --> 06:18.500]  So and what I want to lay more emphasis on is you can see that the four points, the last\n",
            "[06:18.500 --> 06:33.020]  slide that was showing 350 million revenue and the 41 million every month.\n",
            "[06:33.020 --> 06:36.900]  So at least like I said, so we all know that on a monthly basis, we are targeting.\n",
            "[06:36.900 --> 06:42.220]  So this is how for every location based on those that we think we want to, with our increasing\n",
            "[06:43.220 --> 06:48.780]  But I've actually put number seven, number eight, number six, seven and eight into right.\n",
            "[06:48.780 --> 06:51.300]  So that because that is where the department will come in for.\n",
            "[06:51.300 --> 06:55.740]  So whichever figure that we're seeing for every department is going to come from our\n",
            "[06:55.740 --> 07:01.400]  budgeted figure for number six and number six, number seven, number eight.\n",
            "[07:01.400 --> 07:07.660]  So you will notice that for these two, this is almost about 217 million point five eight.\n",
            "[07:07.660 --> 07:11.700]  That is what we have as budgeted revenue for number six and number seven and number\n",
            "[07:11.700 --> 07:12.700]  eight.\n",
            "[07:12.700 --> 07:16.420]  I've split it into two because I don't know, we might probably be doing it as a whole,\n",
            "[07:16.420 --> 07:21.140]  but as I said, maybe initially I would like to see what is coming out from number six\n",
            "[07:21.140 --> 07:24.200]  and to but later in the year, we might probably put everything together.\n",
            "[07:24.200 --> 07:30.380]  So then the same thing also about the PBT, 14 million expected budgeted from number seven\n",
            "[07:30.380 --> 07:34.100]  and 26, 12.6 million from number six.\n",
            "[07:34.100 --> 07:36.660]  So this is where I'm actually going.\n",
            "[07:36.660 --> 07:44.340]  So the number six, I mean, the budgeted revenue and the PBT for number six, number seven,\n",
            "[07:44.340 --> 07:51.860]  number eight, I've actually put them in two classifications, diagnostics and non-diagnostics.\n",
            "[07:51.860 --> 08:02.940]  Diagnostics are the radiology, deuteros, I mean, gastric, the lab, the CT, we know them\n",
            "[08:02.940 --> 08:03.940]  now.\n",
            "[08:03.940 --> 08:04.940]  Okay.\n",
            "[08:04.940 --> 08:07.620]  So yes, yeah.\n",
            "[08:07.620 --> 08:13.220]  So if this is for the clinical, every month, that's what I make it very, I mean, even that\n",
            "[08:13.220 --> 08:20.220]  is not like progressive, so that we all know that for clinical, we're expecting an 86.48\n",
            "[08:20.220 --> 08:25.300]  million every month and we're expecting a PBT of 10 million.\n",
            "[08:25.300 --> 08:29.300]  So if clinical are able to give us this every month, we will be able to move closer to the\n",
            "[08:29.300 --> 08:30.300]  budget.\n",
            "[08:30.300 --> 08:30.820]  Next slide.\n",
            "[08:34.940 --> 08:49.340]  It's not moving.\n",
            "[08:49.340 --> 08:50.340]  Yeah, it's not moving.\n",
            "[08:50.340 --> 08:53.340]  I'm trying to move to the next slide and it's not moving.\n",
            "[09:04.940 --> 09:12.940]  So while you are waiting for the slides, did you break it down for them or you left it\n",
            "[09:12.940 --> 09:17.940]  to them to go and sort all up in the foundation too?\n",
            "[09:17.940 --> 09:18.940]  No.\n",
            "[09:18.940 --> 09:22.380]  So what I'm going to do, I'm going to share this slide and also the Excel sheet that will\n",
            "[09:22.380 --> 09:27.500]  show the list of how this figure, I mean, each of those revenue stream, what we're expecting\n",
            "[09:27.500 --> 09:32.300]  from there and they will see how, that's why I put the annual and the monthly, they will\n",
            "[09:32.300 --> 09:37.300]  see in the Excel sheet what total is 1.2, this amount of 1 billion and 78.\n",
            "[09:37.300 --> 09:42.300]  I mean, so that is what, so I'm not sending the PowerPoint alone.\n",
            "[09:42.300 --> 09:49.300]  I'm also sending it with the Excel sheet that shows the breakdown of all the figures.\n",
            "[09:49.300 --> 10:08.300]  So I'm going to share this slide and I'm going to show you how I'm going to do it.\n",
            "[10:08.300 --> 10:17.300]  So I'm going to show you how I'm going to do it.\n",
            "[10:18.300 --> 10:19.300]  Yeah.\n",
            "[10:19.300 --> 10:20.300]  Nothing is different.\n",
            "[10:20.300 --> 10:21.300]  It's not moving.\n",
            "[10:21.300 --> 10:22.300]  I have for nothing.\n",
            "[10:22.300 --> 10:25.300]  They are about, like I said, they are about five.\n",
            "[10:25.300 --> 10:29.300]  We have clinical, we have nothing.\n",
            "[10:29.300 --> 10:30.300]  We have pharmacy.\n",
            "[10:30.300 --> 10:31.300]  Yes.\n",
            "[10:31.300 --> 10:32.300]  I actually broke down.\n",
            "[10:32.300 --> 10:34.300]  I separated pharmacy.\n",
            "[10:34.300 --> 10:35.300]  Pharmacy.\n",
            "[10:35.300 --> 10:36.300]  Yeah.\n",
            "[10:36.300 --> 10:41.300]  Because there's a line item on our budget that talks about pharmacy alone.\n",
            "[10:41.300 --> 10:43.300]  So I separated pharmacy.\n",
            "[10:43.300 --> 10:44.300]  Okay.\n",
            "[10:45.300 --> 10:54.300]  So what is the number six that you are giving them 12 million?\n",
            "[10:54.300 --> 11:01.300]  Because the, we said it last year, the services in number seven and eight are the ones moving\n",
            "[11:01.300 --> 11:05.300]  to number six, except the additional, maybe six is cut.\n",
            "[11:05.300 --> 11:06.300]  So why?\n",
            "[11:06.300 --> 11:11.300]  I don't know if you can, except to show us what's broken up.\n",

            "[11:20.300 --> 11:22.300]  Stop sharing and then you share again.\n",
            "[11:22.300 --> 11:24.300]  It's supposed to start there.\n",

            "[11:26.300 --> 11:28.300]  I'm not starting.\n",

            "[11:37.300 --> 11:39.300]  It doesn't start with the implanted.\n",
            "[11:39.300 --> 11:40.300]  Okay.\n",
            "[11:40.300 --> 11:42.300]  I'm not pushing them to make this.\n",

            "[12:27.300 --> 12:31.300]  This one, you know, in the sense that you finish what you say, and you guess how I'm\n",
            "[12:31.300 --> 12:36.300]  supposed to talk about this.\n",
            "[12:36.300 --> 12:39.300]  Maybe we should take his picture, I'll see network issue.\n",
            "[12:39.300 --> 12:41.300]  It's from his end.\n",
            "[12:41.300 --> 12:43.300]  The network issue.\n",
            "[12:43.300 --> 12:44.300]  Yes, the network issue.\n",

            "[12:45.300 --> 12:52.300]  I think that's the problem starts when I actually put it on slideshow too.\n",
            "[12:52.300 --> 12:55.300]  Have you changed it to your laptop since?\n",
            "[12:55.300 --> 13:00.300]  Yes, no, this is a new laptop.\n",
            "[13:01.300 --> 13:06.300]  Have you made the best of this?\n",
            "[13:06.300 --> 13:10.300]  Okay, so can everyone see my screen?\n",
            "[13:10.300 --> 13:16.300]  How to be told that?\n",
            "[13:47.300 --> 13:51.300]  Why are you saying plus?\n",
            "[13:51.300 --> 13:56.300]  I know, this thing has probably...\n",
            "[13:56.300 --> 14:00.300]  Just okay, just leave it. I'm adding this.\n",
            "[14:00.300 --> 14:03.300]  So you left clinical.\n",
            "[14:03.300 --> 14:07.300]  Yes, so the first one is the clinical.\n",
            "[14:07.300 --> 14:14.300]  So now I'm moving to the next one, which is the geology, that's the CT scan.\n",
            "[14:14.300 --> 14:18.300]  The CT scans are expecting a 16.7 million revenue.\n",
            "[14:18.300 --> 14:23.300]  Before you go on, can you clarify that this clinical means what? What does it mean?\n",
            "[14:23.300 --> 14:29.300]  So clinical is actually what we're expecting from the non-diagnostic.\n",
            "[14:29.300 --> 14:32.300]  So it does not involve the pharmacy.\n",
            "[14:32.300 --> 14:34.300]  Pharmacy has been taken away.\n",
            "[14:34.300 --> 14:37.300]  All this thing is on top of it. Are you not seeing your screen?\n",
            "[14:37.300 --> 14:42.300]  Okay, so clinical is just, you know, the non-diagnostics.\n",
            "[14:42.300 --> 14:50.300]  So also because the pharmacy, I accept I have to include pharmacy as part of it, but I separated it from pharmacy.\n",
            "[14:50.300 --> 14:53.300]  Okay, so I'm also separated.\n",
            "[14:53.300 --> 14:56.300]  Please speak as if you know this business.\n",
            "[14:56.300 --> 14:59.300]  I don't know anything about non-diagnostics.\n",
            "[14:59.300 --> 15:03.300]  So that means if you say everything that is non-diagnostic is inside here.\n",
            "[15:03.300 --> 15:08.300]  Does that include clinical?\n",
            "[15:08.300 --> 15:11.300]  I'm sorry, does that include pharmacy?\n",
            "[15:11.300 --> 15:14.300]  It's very clear now.\n",
            "[15:14.300 --> 15:17.300]  Okay, so the answer is yes.\n",
            "[15:17.300 --> 15:20.300]  Okay, so the answer is yes.\n",
            "[15:20.300 --> 15:23.300]  So, I'll be very clear.\n",
            "[15:23.300 --> 15:29.300]  So I took out pharmacy and also took out nursing.\n",
            "[15:29.300 --> 15:37.300]  So those two separate because the intention is to you know, these are areas where we can actually, we can focus on getting more revenue.\n",
            "[15:37.300 --> 15:38.300]  So that's what I felt.\n",
            "[15:38.300 --> 15:41.300]  Okay, I took out pharmacy and I took out nursing.\n",
            "[15:41.300 --> 15:46.300]  So clinical on its own, nursing on its own, and also patient care.\n",
            "[15:46.300 --> 15:51.340]  pharmacy and I took a diagnosis. So, clinical on his own, nursing on his own, and pharmacy\n",
            "[15:51.340 --> 15:56.620]  on his own. So, you will have, you have the components of what, why you arrived at this,\n",
            "[15:56.620 --> 16:06.060]  the HCCS, HCCS, yes, yes. You have the document. I have the document, yes, on Excel. So, I'll\n",
            "[16:06.060 --> 16:11.260]  be sharing it. When you share that document, they will review it and you know what, it\n",
            "[16:11.260 --> 16:15.340]  didn't happen. Please share that document as we speak so that as soon as you are done\n",
            "[16:15.340 --> 16:20.620]  with this presentation. All right, sir. So, let me go to the next line. The next one is\n",
            "[16:20.620 --> 16:26.220]  the CT scans. We're very fast. So, 16 million revenue and we're expecting like 2 million\n",
            "[16:26.780 --> 16:34.300]  PBT every month. So, next is the ultrasound and an S-TRADE, 12 million every month and\n",
            "[16:34.300 --> 16:43.020]  expecting 1.45 a PBT. The next is the lab, 40 million every month. I'm very sure I had\n",
            "[16:43.020 --> 16:48.140]  this conversation with Dr. Okudu about this, that this is 40 million every month and we're\n",
            "[16:48.140 --> 16:57.660]  expecting a 4.8 revenue, I mean PBT every month from lab. Pharmacy, 44.5 million every month.\n",
            "[16:57.660 --> 17:02.780]  Like I said, I have an Excel sheet that make up the total amount. The budget is an annual.\n",
            "[17:03.660 --> 17:10.060]  So, I'll be showing that. Yeah, I will send that with this PowerPoint. So, it's PBT of 5.35.\n",
            "[17:11.020 --> 17:21.180]  Nothing, 16 million every month, then about 1.9 for profit every, I mean, PBT every month.\n",
            "[17:21.820 --> 17:26.220]  So, I think that's just the story. So, I will share this and there is an Excel sheet that make\n",
            "[17:26.220 --> 17:35.420]  up all these people. I mentioned that dialysis was mentioned when I when I spoke about the\n",

            "[17:40.540 --> 17:48.540]  this is when Ikeja, Afam, you can see UBA house. The way you separated those ones,\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            "[07:21.200 --> 07:23.200]  And I said cable is involved.\n",

            "[08:09.200 --> 08:12.200]  Ask them if they can send somebody to come and help us do it.\n",
            "[08:12.200 --> 08:15.200]  But you know it's not, they're not getting anything from it.\n",
            "[08:15.200 --> 08:19.200]  So they might not want to come.\n",

            "[08:30.200 --> 08:31.200]  No, the angel.\n",
            "[08:31.200 --> 08:33.200]  Or can they speak to him?\n",
            "[08:33.200 --> 08:34.200]  These are issues.\n",
            "[08:34.200 --> 08:35.200]  One bit.\n",

            "[08:36.200 --> 08:41.200]  Because I'm going into those people don't know how to do it.\n",
            "[08:41.200 --> 08:45.200]  And if they say they will pay, there's no way of paying.\n",
            "[08:45.200 --> 08:51.200]  I think I have a problem with Timothy who interfaces and comes to his vento.\n",
            "[08:51.200 --> 08:53.200]  It's almost defaulted to be.\n",
            "[08:53.200 --> 08:56.200]  So you know it wasn't supposed to be a cost.\n",
            "[08:56.200 --> 09:00.200]  Because, guys, anything that is technical that has to do with procurement,\n",
            "[09:00.200 --> 09:03.200]  it acquires the top-rated whatever.\n",
            "[09:03.200 --> 09:07.200]  This machine on behalf of the organization is our contact person.\n",
            "[09:07.200 --> 09:09.200]  Please, please don't be in my way.\n",
            "[09:09.200 --> 09:10.200]  Yes.\n",
            "[09:10.200 --> 09:16.200]  Not that it will be too much.\n",
            "[09:16.200 --> 09:18.200]  Not this who came and moved.\n",
            "[09:18.200 --> 09:20.200]  Phyllis came and moved the equipment.\n",
            "[09:20.200 --> 09:22.200]  The plan was that as they've moved it,\n",
            "[09:22.200 --> 09:24.200]  all you have to do is connect the scale.\n",
            "[09:24.200 --> 09:26.200]  That was how this thing was supposed to pan out.\n",
            "[09:26.200 --> 09:27.200]  They're supposed to have just connected.\n",
            "[09:27.200 --> 09:28.200]  It was straightforward.\n",
            "[09:28.200 --> 09:30.200]  They would have done it that day if they didn't move.\n",
            "[09:30.200 --> 09:31.200]  But since it didn't happen,\n",
            "[09:31.200 --> 09:33.200]  they now said, ah, this thing is more than this.\n",
            "[09:33.200 --> 09:35.200]  They said all they need from biostatics\n",
            "[09:35.200 --> 09:37.200]  is a code for their printer.\n",
            "[09:37.200 --> 09:39.200]  So they mostly helped them get the code\n",
            "[09:39.200 --> 09:40.200]  for the printer.\n",
            "[09:40.200 --> 09:41.200]  Here's Phyllis.\n",
            "[09:41.200 --> 09:42.200]  This is the code.\n",
            "[09:42.200 --> 09:44.200]  They now did it so that it's more than code.\n",
            "[09:44.200 --> 09:46.200]  Cable is involved.\n",
            "[09:46.200 --> 09:48.200]  So that's how the whole thing started.\n",
            "[09:48.200 --> 09:51.200]  It was something that was supposed to be pretty much straightforward.\n",
            "[09:51.200 --> 09:53.200]  They didn't need to be calling to me.\n",
            "[09:53.200 --> 09:55.200]  Phyllis had been in the moment.\n",
            "[09:55.200 --> 09:56.200]  He was aware.\n",
            "[09:56.200 --> 09:57.200]  Yes, he was aware.\n",
            "[09:57.200 --> 09:59.200]  So let's all understand.\n",
            "[09:59.200 --> 10:00.200]  That's the thing.\n",
            "[10:00.200 --> 10:03.200]  Eventually, we're getting...\n",

            "[10:04.200 --> 10:06.200]  We're getting a very interesting thing.\n",

            "[10:08.200 --> 10:12.200]  We'll still be working with it.\n",
            "[10:14.200 --> 10:18.200]  It's not so big to reach out to the right people\n",
            "[10:18.200 --> 10:20.200]  for the cable, whatever.\n",
            "[10:20.200 --> 10:22.200]  It's not a big deal to me.\n",
            "[10:22.200 --> 10:24.200]  What have they done so far?\n",
            "[10:25.200 --> 10:29.200]  Then for the digital x-ray,\n",
            "[10:29.200 --> 10:33.200]  I put last quarter in my...\n",

            "[10:45.200 --> 10:48.200]  But there are limitations to the one we currently use.\n",
            "[10:48.200 --> 10:51.200]  And I feel like when our films start going out\n",
            "[10:51.200 --> 10:53.200]  and doctors see that it's not digital,\n",
            "[10:53.200 --> 10:55.200]  they might be encouraged to...\n",
            "[10:55.200 --> 10:57.200]  How much is this x-ray?\n",

            "[20:07.200 --> 20:09.200]  and then you pay those portals.\n",

            "[20:36.200 --> 20:39.200]  So the plan is to employ somebody,\n",
            "[20:39.200 --> 20:42.200]  depending on the revenue we are able to generate from it,\n",
            "[20:42.200 --> 20:46.200]  not even standard nursing, maybe in nurse assistants,\n",
            "[20:46.200 --> 20:49.200]  because basically what you are doing is feeding baby,\n",

            "[21:02.200 --> 21:04.200]  So that's it.\n",
            "[21:04.200 --> 21:06.200]  That's wonderful.\n",

            "[21:18.200 --> 21:22.200]  So the plan is to attach a nurse to that person\n",
            "[21:22.200 --> 21:24.200]  and deal with them for weeks.\n",
            "[21:24.200 --> 21:26.200]  These are ways we can generate revenue.\n",
            "[21:26.200 --> 21:32.200]  Another way I talked of is for instruments, autoclaving.\n",
            "[21:32.200 --> 21:36.200]  So we noticed that when you are visiting\n",

            "[21:44.200 --> 21:46.200]  but they always look for ways to sterilize.\n",
            "[21:46.200 --> 21:51.200]  So I recently have been telling the pathic surgeon\n",
            "[21:51.200 --> 21:53.200]  that he can bring his instruments to sterilize it for him,\n",
            "[21:53.200 --> 21:55.200]  but we're billing.\n",
            "[21:55.200 --> 21:59.200]  We're billing depending on the size of the equipment\n",
            "[21:59.200 --> 22:01.200]  or the instruments.\n",
            "[22:01.200 --> 22:03.200]  So for also people that have parts,\n",
            "[22:03.200 --> 22:06.200]  a normal of instruments and they are big,\n",
            "[22:06.200 --> 22:09.200]  we can bill as much as 30,000 just so to play once,\n",
            "[22:09.200 --> 22:11.200]  and then you can't begin.\n",
            "[22:11.200 --> 22:13.200]  But we still have something like a trade,\n",
            "[22:13.200 --> 22:15.200]  like develop it for you to play with us,\n",
            "[22:15.200 --> 22:17.200]  and pay us 10,000 to play.\n",
            "[22:21.200 --> 22:24.200]  That's it, sir.\n",
            "[22:24.200 --> 22:26.200]  Every lab procedure.\n",
            "[22:26.200 --> 22:29.200]  It does sound like a lot.\n",
            "[22:29.200 --> 22:31.200]  You have numbers.\n",
            "[22:31.200 --> 22:34.200]  How many people are you looking at here today?\n",
            "[22:34.200 --> 22:36.200]  Should I expect them to come in?\n",
            "[22:36.200 --> 22:38.200]  Everybody should do that.\n",
            "[22:38.200 --> 22:41.200]  It's not just sound interesting,\n",
            "[22:41.200 --> 22:46.200]  but it must be achievable.\n",
            "[22:46.200 --> 22:50.200]  And then find a way to collect towards finance essentially.\n",
            "[22:50.200 --> 22:55.200]  Okay.\n",
            "[22:55.200 --> 22:57.200]  I must say the ideas are important.\n",
            "[22:57.200 --> 23:01.200]  I actually find they are good.\n",
            "[23:01.200 --> 23:06.200]  In extension, for mothers in recovery,\n",
            "[23:06.200 --> 23:12.200]  what if they replace this baby-miner's video?\n",
            "[23:12.200 --> 23:14.200]  Yes.\n",
            "[23:14.200 --> 23:18.200]  Yes, but that will be that we don't have to start to accommodate\n",
            "[23:18.200 --> 23:21.200]  that yet to employ the middleman.\n",
            "[23:21.200 --> 23:23.200]  When employing for you,\n",
            "[23:23.200 --> 23:27.200]  we take out what we think is most attached to it.\n",
            "[23:27.200 --> 23:29.200]  So it's going to be an external person.\n",
            "[23:29.200 --> 23:32.200]  So we recruit, we do the recruitment ourselves.\n",
            "[23:32.200 --> 23:33.200]  Okay.\n",
            "[23:33.200 --> 23:36.200]  Because I was going to add the continuity of the person you're recruiting.\n",
            "[23:36.200 --> 23:39.200]  Yes, so this is based on MCC.\n",
            "[23:39.200 --> 23:41.200]  So the process is we recruit.\n",
            "[23:41.200 --> 23:44.200]  Once the person says I'm done with you,\n",
            "[23:44.200 --> 23:48.200]  we keep the person and tell the person that when we need you again,\n",
            "[23:48.200 --> 23:50.200]  we will call you.\n",
            "[23:50.200 --> 23:52.200]  So once we are done with you,\n",
            "[23:52.200 --> 23:54.200]  you can bring us as long as possible.\n",
            "[23:54.200 --> 24:00.200]  Just keep sending you to different zones.\n",
            "[24:00.200 --> 24:06.200]  Any other comments for taking your question?\n",
            "[24:06.200 --> 24:08.200]  Before you came,\n",
            "[24:08.200 --> 24:11.200]  I would like to thank you for your time with us.\n",
            "[24:11.200 --> 24:16.200]  I expect that you will summarize the version of the goals\n",

            "[24:23.200 --> 24:28.200]  That man says yes.\n",
            "[24:28.200 --> 24:30.200]  We will review with you.\n",
            "[24:30.200 --> 24:32.200]  You should be ready by today.\n",
            "[24:32.200 --> 24:40.200]  We will review before sending out.\n",
            "[24:40.200 --> 24:42.200]  I need you to stay with yourself.\n",
            "[24:42.200 --> 24:43.200]  I wanted you to mention,\n",
            "[24:43.200 --> 24:47.200]  as Sarah said, about starting off in Massif.\n",
            "[24:47.200 --> 24:48.200]  Okay.\n",
            "[24:48.200 --> 24:54.200]  I'm not saying that.\n",
            "[24:54.200 --> 24:59.200]  Okay.\n",
            "[24:59.200 --> 25:06.200]  So I was telling her about the need to get a platform or something.\n",
            "[25:06.200 --> 25:11.200]  We wanted to put.\n",
            "[25:11.200 --> 25:13.200]  I mean on Monday.\n",
            "[25:13.200 --> 25:14.200]  And then.\n",
            "[25:14.200 --> 25:15.200]  So we.\n",
            "[25:15.200 --> 25:21.200]  That's a good thing.\n",
            "[25:21.200 --> 25:24.200]  And then from there.\n",
            "[25:24.200 --> 25:30.200]  So we went.\n",
            "[25:30.200 --> 25:32.200]  Actually.\n",
            "[25:32.200 --> 25:35.200]  Doesn't need.\n",
            "[25:35.200 --> 25:42.200]  So, yeah.\n",
            "[25:42.200 --> 25:48.840]  out of bound. The people here, the whatever has 16, we have them, that were in fact the new ones.\n",
            "[25:48.840 --> 25:49.340]  Yes.\n",
            "[25:53.160 --> 25:56.040]  No, we wanted to paint out a new one on that piece.\n",
            "[25:57.800 --> 26:00.760]  If it's out of bound, we need a proper out of bound sign.\n",
            "[26:03.560 --> 26:08.600]  So what it's nice to say is that we get it then. Usually we have it then, but after we do those\n",
            "[26:08.600 --> 26:14.440]  things, but after we do those things, so if you want it, you will request for a new sign made,\n",
            "[26:15.240 --> 26:20.120]  with no serums. So she now went to, so I told her to go to Sarah, so that Sarah can get those things\n",
            "[26:20.120 --> 26:25.960]  for us, so that we can put in there, because the rest of the room has no sign made. So when she\n",
            "[26:25.960 --> 26:31.800]  got to Sarah, because we're thinking by this week, everything will be, please don't move the oxygen,\n",
            "[26:31.800 --> 26:38.360]  and all of those. Sarah now made the comments that we need to get\n",
            "[26:38.920 --> 26:46.760]  some sort of operation that we can start. We can't just move in there and start the operation.\n",
            "[26:48.840 --> 26:55.640]  So I don't know, I think we just talked to Sarah a little bit without carrying me along. So when\n",
            "[26:55.640 --> 27:00.760]  Sarah said that you did you escalate it, because Sarah, one thing about Sarah is that Sarah would\n",
            "[27:00.760 --> 27:06.600]  not escalate anything. So this stuck with Sarah, and I told her, so that's a logic,\n",
            "[27:06.600 --> 27:11.400]  but that's the way she knows how to work, so I can't really bend that. But then you that\n",
            "[27:11.400 --> 27:15.720]  you are requesting, you're asking Sarah to report to someone, the way she told you that you escalated\n",
            "[27:16.520 --> 27:24.440]  it. So it's that thing that I spoke to the other house presenting, that we have submitted our papers,\n",
            "[27:24.440 --> 27:32.280]  but they are saying it's still in the process of to allow Sarah. So but that doesn't stop us from\n",
            "[27:32.280 --> 27:37.560]  operating. So I don't know why she said that, but I'll ask her. Because it wasn't like that,\n",
            "[27:37.560 --> 27:42.360]  it was when I was putting her other pressure that we want to start next week. We have a printer now,\n",
            "[27:42.360 --> 27:46.200]  we are going there, but I'm not seeing our printer. They didn't say we shouldn't start. They now said\n",
            "[27:46.200 --> 27:50.200]  if you come down, you need a set date of operation. They didn't say we shouldn't start.\n",
            "[27:50.440 --> 27:54.920]  We know that we need a set date of operation, but did she have to wait for you to come and say?\n",
            "[27:57.000 --> 28:02.120]  Because we started early, we had, in fact, I was one pushing around last day, so we had a solution,\n",
            "[28:02.120 --> 28:08.760]  it was for a new facility. That facility, for the building is there. Yes, they said we had to.\n",
            "[28:08.760 --> 28:12.680]  Or African Lagos State. African Lagos, they said Lagos State,\n",
            "[28:12.680 --> 28:17.800]  we know it's all African Lagos, the ministry of things. So they told us that we need to\n",
            "[28:18.760 --> 28:24.280]  to register that facility separately for number eight. Yes.\n",
            "[28:26.280 --> 28:30.840]  No, we did not, because this was, this was an illness of number eight.\n",
